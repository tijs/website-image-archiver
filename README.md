# Website archiver

This is a simple script that scrapes a website and downloads all images into the directories found

* The specific use case was my mother's portfolio website so this probably won't work for your use case
* It will skip things that look like thumbnails, again â€“ for my use case
* It will log what it's doing and retry failed downloads

Feel free to try it out but if you break things it will only be your own fault, i am not responsible for any damages you cause with this code.

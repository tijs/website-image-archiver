# Website archiver

This is a simple script that scrapes a website and doiwnloads all images into the directories found

* The specific use case was my mothers portfolio website so this probably won't work for your use case
* It will skip things that look like thumbnails, again; for my use case
* It will log what it's doing and retry failed downloads

Feel free to try it out but if you break things it will only be your own fault, i am not responsible for any damages you cause with this code.
